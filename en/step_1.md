You can also click **2D** at the top of the Scene view to see the text. 

Click on the **Canvas** containing your TextMeshPro in the Hierarchy window, make sure it is active, and use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> to focus on it. 

Click on your **UI Object** (TextMeshPro, Panel, Button) in the Hierarchy window and then drag it into position in the Scene view.

Click **2D** again to return to 3D mode. You may also want to disable the Canvas if it was previously disabled.

**Tip:** When positioning buttons in 2D view, make sure you have the Button selected, not just its text child object.
